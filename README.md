# Recipe Generator Project 
After learning about APIs and local storage I decided to build a website that's able to search up recipes based on what's inside someone's pantry. Functionality of this website 
- able remember user's favourite recipes 
- fetches recipes from edamam.com based on user's input
- user can de-select favourites recipes and it'll be removed from local storage 

I've also practice using boostrap - the first time I've ever used it - although at least learning how to use it took a long time I can see how it'll drastically decrease time to build a website in the future. 

This was also a great project to further practice my JavaScript problem solving skills, I feel like my logic and code structure is a lot cleaner than my eariler projects.
